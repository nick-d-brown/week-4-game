                Game Rules and description:
            </h2>
            <p>
                At the start of the game a random number will be chosen. The goal is for the player to get their score to equal the random number that was chosen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 4 crystals in the cave, and each crystal is worth a random value. The player must click on the crystals in order to increase their score.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the player's score is equal to the random word chosen the player will win. If the player's score is greater than the number chosen the player loses. The player has an unlimited number of clicks on the crystals so long as the player's score is not greater than the random number chosen.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the start of every new game a new random number will be chosen and the values of each crystal will be changed. 
            </p>

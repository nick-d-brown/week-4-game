The Crystal Game

This Jquery based web game starts when a random number is chosen at the beginning of the game for the player. The player must choose from 4 different crystals to click. Each crystal is assigned a random value at the start of each game. The goal of the game is click on the crystals to increase the player's score and attempt to match it to the random number chosen. If the player's score goes over the random number, then they lose and the game starts over. If the player's score equals the random number chosen, then the player wins and the game starts over. 

The design for this game is inspired from early 2000's internt game theme's and provided several challenges in its creation. Among them were the utilization of CSS animations and background layers, in addition to the development of game logic. This is my first project utilizing the Jquery library and was key in becoming comfortable with the slight changes in syntax from Vanilla JavaScript.
